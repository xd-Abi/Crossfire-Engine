## The Plan

The plan for Crossfire is to create a powerful and easy to use 3D engine with a clean design. This game engine is inspired by [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel "Hazel Github").

## Short term goals :

- Faster 2D and 3D rendering
- Support for diffrent Platforms
- Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Clean GUI
- Audio system
